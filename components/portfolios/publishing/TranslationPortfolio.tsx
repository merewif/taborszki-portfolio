          Over a 3 year period I taught myself the basics of graphic design, with a heavy emphasis on
          typography, using primarily Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator.

          Originally it started out from the need to create visually captivating thumbnails for blogposts. I
          then went on to create designs for various items of clothing that enjoyed a modicum of success -
          customers bought them all over the world from the United States to India. Lastly I went on to design
          book covers for dozens of books.
